## 🧠 How to Use

1. **Duplicate the template files**:
   - Copy everything from `/Template/` into the root as `COURSECODE.html` (e.g. `eng4u.html`).

2. **Replace the content** in `template.html`:
   - Update unit titles, curriculum expectations, evaluation breakdown, and resources.
   - Refer to your Ministry-approved course outlines.

3. **Keep styles and JS consistent**:
   - Do not rename `template.css` and `template.js` unless required.
   - All templates link to the same structure for maintainability.
